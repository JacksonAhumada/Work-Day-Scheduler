# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

I wanted to create a Schedule daily agenda that a user could add tasks based off of the hour of the workday and save them to be viewed later. The agenda time sections will change color based off the current time the user is interacting with the schedule. 

## Usage 

Go to the schedule website and type the task you want to schedule in the time you want the task in. Click the save button and the task will be saved for the next time the user visits that website.
